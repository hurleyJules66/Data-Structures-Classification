📚 Data Structures Classification and Applications (C Language)
👨‍💻 Group Assignment – Data Structures and Algorithms

Course: Data Structures and Algorithms
Duration: 2 Weeks
Programming Language: C

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the classification of data structures and their implementation using the C programming language. It also explains real-world applications of each data structure and why they are used in computer systems.

🗂 Data Structure Classifications Implemented
🔹 Linear Data Structures
Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
🔹 Non-Linear Data Structures
Trees
Graphs
🔹 Hash-Based Structure
Hash Tables

💻 Objectives
Implement data structures using C
Understand real-world applications
Explain why specific data structures are used in systems
Demonstrate algorithms working with data structures

📖 Real World Applications
Data Structure	Application	Reason
Array	Storing marks, image pixels	Fast access using index
Linked List	Music playlists	Easy insertion and deletion
Stack	Undo operations	Last In First Out
Queue	Printer queue, CPU scheduling	First In First Out
Tree	File system structure	Hierarchical storage
Graph	GPS navigation	Shows relationships
Hash Table	Password storage	Very fast searching
⚙ Role of Data Structures in Systems

Data structures help systems:
Store data efficiently
Improve program performance
Reduce memory wastage
Support fast searching and sorting

🧠 Algorithms Used
Searching Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms
Traversal Algorithms
